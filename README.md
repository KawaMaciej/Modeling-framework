# ðŸ§  Modeling Framework

A modular and extensible Python framework for building and experimenting with machine learning models â€” including custom implementations of linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet using gradient descent and many others.

  - Error metrics: MAE, RMSE, MSE, RÂ², Adjusted RÂ²
  - Cross-validation (KFold)
  - Outlier detection (Cook's distance)
  - Interactive visualization with Plotly

## Notes

- All models are implemented from scratch for learning purposes.
- Diagnostics and metrics are also custom implementations.
- See the notebook for detailed examples and tests.
